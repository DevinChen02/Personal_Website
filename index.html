        <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 18px;">Hi there, this is Devin. I'm a 3rd year undergraduate student at UCSD, still searching for my 
            interest and looking for the meaning of life. I'll constantly update my status here, without any 
            particular reason, with no intention to target any audience. This is a space where I can write and 
            talk whatever I want. I guess this website will help me to keep track of my life progress, as a student 
            and as a perplexed human being.
